# Programming_Test
## GSoC 2018 Programming competency Test
### Source Code Files:
test1.hpp,

test13.cpp

#### test1.hpp
This header file contains the headers to perform all the matrix operation as stated in the competency test i.e., + and * ,+= and * =. These files may still have bugs and it will be very kind of you if you send it to me using issue pages or on my mail [raj.himanshu2@gmail.com]

#### test13.cpp
This .cpp file tests the header file for the above operations mentioned.

Thank You,

Himanshu Raj
